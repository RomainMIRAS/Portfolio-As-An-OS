Since then, I've specialized in various technical environments, with a particular appetite for collaborative projects and solving concrete problems.\n\nDuring my experiences, I've worked on projects combining backend development (Node.js, Python...), DevOps (CI/CD, Docker, GitLab), and sometimes frontend (React). I enjoy exploring the entire application lifecycle, from design to production deployment.\n\nI'm open to permanent contract or VIE opportunities in DevOps, Backend or FullStack from September 2025, in France or internationally.",
